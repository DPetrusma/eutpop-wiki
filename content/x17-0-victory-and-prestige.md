# 17. Victory & Prestige (`0`)

The most common Victory Condition for
the various scenarios in the game is to be the
player with the most Prestige (0) at the
end of the game.
Prestige is scored in several different ways
during and at the end of the game.
Final Scoring happens in Phase 5 of the
Round in which the end of the game has
been triggered, as described on page 11.
Some scenarios will have different Final
Scoring criteria.
17.1 The Prestige Track
Prestige (0) scored during
the game is indicated with the
Prestige Markers on the Prestige
Track, which is located on the
Distant Continents board.
The main sources of 0 during the
course of the game are Missions, Milestones,
Power Struggles (if used), Ideas, and Events.
Once a player's 0 exceeds 60, flip their
Prestige Marker to the “+60” side, and continue
counting additional 0 from the start
of the track. If a player's 0 falls below 0,
place a Negative Prestige token
on top of their Prestige Marker,
to indicate that its position
shows a negative 0 value.
In some scenarios, the end of the
game is triggered when a player passes a certain
amount of 0 on the Prestige Track.
17.2 Missions
Each of the Major Powers of the game has
an individual deck of Mission Cards. In
addition, there are 2 generic Mission Decks
that can be used to compose Mission Decks
for other Realms. Each Scenario will specify
which Missions are available to each playable
Realm at the start of the game.
Some Missions have a green frame and
background, indicating them as starting Missions
for the regular 1444 setup. For such a
game, players will normally pick 2 of these
Missions at the start of the game.
Striving towards completing Missions
provides clear intermediate goals during
the course of the game, and tends to send a
Realm down a semi-historical path. They are
particularly useful to new players, but certainly
add both flavor and dynamism to the
game for seasoned gamers, too.
Experienced groups of gamers who prefer
a complete sandbox experience can remove
Missions from the game entirely, if all players
agree to it.
Mission Prerequisites
All Missions have a Mission ID (in the red
circle at the bottom of the card). Certain
Missions require you to have completed at
least 1 of the listed prerequisite Missions
(indicated to the left of the Mission ID)
before they can be picked. In turn, these
may unlock other Missions (indicated to the
right of the Mission ID) once completed.
Completing a Mission
Missions can be completed at any time except
in Phase 1. To complete a Mission, you must
meet its listed requirements and announce
this to the other players. Upon doing so,
the Mission's listed effects immediately take
place. Mission requirements must be met at
the time of scoring; having previously met a
Mission's requirements does not qualify.
A player who completes a Mission also
receives a number of 0, as stated in the
Mission Card's top right corner.
Mission Rewards
When collecting the Reward from a completed
Mission, follow the 'Event Guidelines'
rules for all effects (see p. 40).
Selecting New Missions
In the next Draw Cards Phase after you have
completed and scored at least 1 Mission in
your hand, you may select new, eligible Missions
from your deck to replace them so that
you once again have 2 Missions in hand.
In the Draw Cards Phase, you may
also put any Mission in your hand back in
the deck, and select a new, eligible one to
replace it with.
17.3 Milestones
Milestones are similar to Missions, but they
are public and may be scored by anyone
who meets their completion requirements.
The 0 reward will be higher for those
who complete the Milestones earlier, thus
providing an arena for competition among
players – even between those who do not
have directly conflicting interests on the map
board.
There are always 4 available Milestones.
In each Age, 1 card is randomly drawn from
each of the 4 decks (Expansion, Politics, Warfare,
and Economics). At the end of each Age,
discard all Milestones and draw new ones
from each of the next Age's decks. Scenarios
may sometimes instruct you to remove certain
Milestones from the game before setup,
or to display predefined Milestones instead of
drawing at random.

Milestones may also be replaced whenever
the Comet Sighted Event is played. In
this case, draw new Milestones from those
remaining for the current Age.
Completing a Milestone
The first player to complete a Milestone
scores 5, the second player scores 3,
and the third scores 1. Subsequent players
completing this Milestone score no 0.
When you complete a Milestone, mark it
with a Tag chit from your Supply.
The tie breaker, if several players complete
a Milestone at the same time, is Turn
order (starting with the Active Player if in
Phase 2, or First Player if in Phases 3 or 4),
unless stated otherwise on the Milestone.
Milestones also provide rewards in the
form of Monarch Power (a, b, or c) or
Ducats (D), as indicated in the lower-right
corner of the card. All players completing a
Milestone receive this same reward.
17.4 Power Struggles
Advanced Rules
Whether you want to include Power Struggles
or not in your game is up to your gaming
group. We recommend that you play
without them in your first game.
Power Struggles add increased levels of
tension, interaction, and conflict between
PRs, since they will be simultaneously competing
for the same objectives.
Just below the card's title, above the horizontal
line, each Power Struggle lists a number
of Battleground Areas (§) where players
will compete for 0. Below the line there
are some additional criteria for gaining or
losing 0 when that card is scored.
Preparing the Power Struggle Deck
Scenario setups have different recommended
Power Struggle Deck compositions. Some
scenarios will suggest Power Struggles to be
sorted in a specific order, while others may
suggest a randomized order.
The deck should be placed face-up with the
top-most card visible to all players – this card
is called the Upcoming Power Struggle.
Claims in Battleground Areas
When taking the Fabricate Claims Action
(see p. 15), players only need to pay 1 b
for each G placed in any Battleground
Area
that is listed on either the Active Power
Struggle or the Upcoming Power Struggle.
Activating Power Struggles
Power Struggles are activated when the relevant
Event symbol is resolved (see section
16.5, p. 41). When the top card of the
deck is moved to the Active Power Struggle
space on the Status Mat, this will also reveal
the new Upcoming Power Struggle, giving
players a chance to prepare for what is coming
next.
Scoring Power Struggles
Any Active Power Struggle will be scored
in the Income & Upkeep Phase, Step E (see
p. 10), before being discarded.
When a Power Struggle is scored, all players
who satisfy the conditions will score 0
as described below:
Scoring Battleground Areas (§)
For each Battleground Area, players will
score 0 as follows:
• 1 per Tax Value of Provinces they Control
there (v count as half)
• 1 for being the only PR with t/v
there (for § on the Main Map only)
• 1 for having at least 1 A/M there
Additional Prestige criteria
Players that satisfy listed criteria may score
additional 0, while players who fail to do
so will sometimes lose 0. These conditions
are often specific to certain Realms.
