# 16. Events

Event Cards give a sense of the flow of history,
and dictate events that are largely outside
players’ control.
The cards include specific historical
events, as well as more generic events that
could have happened at any time and place,
such as epidemics, piracy, dynastic crises,
revolts, and more.
Four Ages – four Event Decks
The Event Deck is divided into 4 Ages: Age of
Discovery (I), Age of Reformation (II), Age
of Absolutism (III), and Age of Revolutions
(IV, Deluxe Ed. / Fate of Empires exp. only).
The Ages in the Event Deck enter play in
chronological order. First you go through all
the Events in Age I, then Age II, etc. At the
end of a Round, when there are no Events
of the current Age remaining in the deck,
prepare the deck for the next Age so that it is
ready for the start of the next Round.
Many scenarios span a fixed number of
Ages and only use Events from these Ages.
Preparing Event Decks
Select all Event Cards for the Age you are
about to start, as listed in the chosen Scenario
Setup. In the setups, the listed Events
will be divided into 2 halves for each Age.
These halves should be shuffled separately,
before the first half is placed on top of the
second, to form the deck.
How to create Event Decks for custom
scenarios is described in Scenario Booklet I.
Optional Rule 6: Randomizing X-Events
Within each Age, Event Cards are marked
with either (1), (2), or (X), in a circle
in the card's top-left corner. The cards
marked (1) must always go in the first
half, while cards marked (2) must go into
the second half. Cards marked with an
(X) can go into either half, but suggestions
are given in the scenario setups for
which half to place each of these cards
in. For a bit more randomness and less
predictability, you can instead use the
following method:
Separate all cards according to these
markings, then shuffle the (X) cards
before distributing them among the (1)
and (2) stacks, ensuring that each stack
has the same number of cards. Shuffle the
(1) stack to form the top half of the Event
Deck for that Age, and shuffle the (2)
stack to form the bottom half of the deck.
16.1 Event Types and
ID Numbers
The Event ID number in the top-right corner
contains some information about what
type of Event this is. The first digit of the ID
number identifies in which Age it belongs.
A-Events have an A in the ID (e.g.,
11A-1). These cards make the engine tick,
and control the mortality of Characters
(as described on p. 41). All scenarios
must include 8 A-Events per Age.
B-Events have a B in the ID (e.g., 354B).
The scenarios list which B-Events should be
used, but it is possible to replace these Events
with other B-Events to provide variation
between games.
Realm-specific Events have a
flag in their lower-right
corner
and no letter in their ID number
(e.g., 202-2).
There are 2 Realm-specific Events per Age
for each of the Major Powers and featured
Realms. The Event Deck will always include
all Events associated with the PRs that are
in play in the chosen scenario, and no other
Realm-specific Events.
Most of these Events have a historical
Ruler (see p. 19) in the bottom section of
the card, associated with the Realm that this
Event belongs to.
16.2 The Event Display
At the start of each Round, in the Draw
Cards Phase, a number of Events equal to
the number of players plus 1 (e.g., 5 Events
in a 4-player game), are drawn from the
top of the deck and placed on display in a
row. The first 3 Events (from the left) are
placed face-up for everyone to see, while the
remaining Events are placed face-down. The
face-down Events get revealed later, as players
take the mandatory Event Action.
Optional Rule 7: Revealing More
If you want a game with less hidden information
in games with 6 players, reveal the
first 4 Events instead of 3. This will result
in more D amassing on the Events.
16.3 Event Guidelines
General Event guidelines
• In comma-separated lists (e.g., of Areas),
we use the word “or” in an inclusive
sense; you may pick any, or even several,
of those items.
• Some Event effects only apply if certain
listed conditions are met. Ignore any
effects whose conditions are not met.
• When required to make a choice between
an A) and a B) option in an Event, if you
cannot meet the requirements or pay the
costs of one of the two options, you must
pick the other option. If not able to pay
for either option, pick either one of them.
• If the Event has effects or choices that
concern more than 1 player, these effects
are resolved player by player, in clockwise
order, starting with the Active player
unless stated otherwise.
• The PR that “gains/loses” makes the choice.
• NPRs say “yes”, e.g., when offered an Alliance
or when they “may” do something.
• The word “you” always refers to the
Active Player or to the player required to
make an A/B-choice.
Standard Event effects
Certain effects are repeated on several
Events. These effects must adhere to the
following guidelines, unless the card specifically
states otherwise.
Use of the word “you” in these guidelines
refer to the beneficiary/victim of the effect.
Gain/place Influence
If an Event says that you gain, or are allowed
to place, a number of I in certain Areas,
this means that you can place this I as
long as there is at least 1 Province in the
Area that is Owned by an NPR or by a Vassal
Realm. If you are unable to place all of this
I due to the 5 I per Area limit, you
may discard Opponent I as required in
order to make space for your own I.
Gain Alliance or Royal Marriage
To gain an Alliance with a Realm, the target
Realm must be an Independent Realm
which is currently at Peace. Realms that
have been Vassalized, Annexed, or are at
War are ineligible targets, and this effect
will be ignored for such Realms.
If the named target is an NPR Ally of an
Opponent, you may only replace their A
with your A if you have at least as many
I as your Opponent in the target's Areas.
To gain a Royal Marriage with a Realm,
the target must be an eligible Marriage partner
(see p. 32).
If you have no available A/M, you may
take 1 of your A/M from the map, as long
as this is not an Active Ally (K) or a Disputed
Succession (L). You will suffer no
penalties for ending an Alliance in this way.
Gain G
You can only have 1 G in each Area.
Gain/place t or v
To gain a t/v on a Province when an
Event says to, that Province cannot already
be Owned, Vassalized, or Occupied by
another PR (no Opponent t/v on it
already), unless specifically stated otherwise.
Develop a Small t into a Large t
Replace 1 of your Small t with a Large t,
updating your Player Mat as appropriate.
The t must be Owned by you.
Gain Merchant
You can only gain a third Merchant from an
Event, a Mission, or the “Free Trade” Idea if
you currently have only 2 Merchants.
Gain Military Unit
When gaining Military Units via Events,
whether they are Land Units or Ships, place
these Units in a location where no Battle is
triggered. If no such location is eligible for
placement, you do not gain these Units. Regular
Units must be taken from Available m.
Gain Action
When you gain an Action from an Event, the
Action is clearly indicated in bold italics; you
must either take this Action immediately or
decline the opportunity. If you are not the
Active player, the Active player then gets to
finish their Turn before play continues in
clockwise order as normal.
Research Idea
When an Event lets you Research an Idea,
you, and any Opponents who have this
Idea already, will score 0 as normal (see
p. 12). If an Event causes multiple players
to Research the same Idea, they all score 0
as normal (Active Player first as usual).
If the Idea named on the Event is currently
not on display and you choose to Research
it, add this Idea to the appropriate
column
of the Idea display and choose an unpicked
non-Basic
Idea of the same type to remove
(if any), or if there are no unpicked Ideas of
that type, create a new row in the Idea display.
Shuffle removed Ideas back into the deck.
Placing DNPR tokens
When placing DNPR tokens (æ), place
the token of that color with a capital C on
it on the DNPR's Capital Province (underlined
when listed on an Event).
If there are any t/v on the Provinces
listed, simply place the æ underneath the
t/v (unless stated otherwise on the
card), but never place æ on a PR's Core
Provinces. A t/v with a æ beneath it is
considered a Core Province of that DNPR.
Terminate/Remove Alliance
When an Event requires you to terminate an
Alliance, remove the appropriate A from
the board.
If this was an Active Ally, you lose a number
of Allied Units from your Manpower
Reserve or Armies equal to ½ of the NPR's
pre-War Tax Income. Your PR Enemies must
place War tokens on your former Active Ally.
Reject Ruler
Sometimes an option on an Event may let
you, or force you to, Reject the historical
Ruler on the very same Event.
In these cases, both your current Ruler and
the Event Card with the new Ruler on it are
discarded once the Event has been resolved.
Area leaves HRE
When an Area leaves the HRE through an
Event, any loss of E is already accounted
for in the Event text itself.
Wars triggered by Events
If a DoW takes place as part of an Event's
effects, and this is not marked as a Declare
War Action, only follow steps 3–7 of the
Declare War Action sequence (see p. 16).
PRs must adhere to all DoW restrictions
(see p. 22) unless stated otherwise, and if
the target is ineligible, no DoW is made.
A PR that has Passed cannot Declare War
via an Event, even if instructed to do so.
If the Aggressor is an NPR, read “you” as
“the NPR” in the Declare War Action steps.
If an Event lets you select a target to
Declare War on, you must select an eligible
target (if possible).
16.4 Unpicked Events
In most scenarios, after each player has taken
the Event Action, there will be an unpicked
Event on display.
The remaining Event will not take effect,
but if it has a historical Ruler on it, the player
associated with that Event may pay 2 a to
appoint the Ruler on the card.
Any symbols at the bottom of the card
will be auto-resolved immediately after the
last player has completed their Event Action,
according to the auto-resolution rules listed
under each symbol on the next page.

16.5 Secondary Effects
Some Events have symbols along the bottom
edge that impact, among other things,
Unrest/Rebels, NPR behavior, and character
mortality (Leaders and Advisors).
After resolving the Event's main text,
these symbols' effects are resolved in order,
from left to right, by the Active Player (you).
Auto-resolution rules are used to resolve
symbol effects on unpicked Events (and for
Events resolved by Bots). Symbols with no
special auto-resolution notes are resolved as
normal. When resolving unpicked Events,
no one is considered to be the Active Player.
Character Mortality
All characters with a symbol next to their
portrait that matches the symbol on the
Event played will receive an Ill Health token
(H). If a character receives a second H,
they die and their card is discarded.
Unrest/Rebellion
All players must roll a Rebel Die for each of
their Provinces with Unrest (u), following
the procedure described on page 37.
You roll a maximum of 1 Rebel Die.
Native Uprising
Each player loses 1 < from the Colonist
Pool and gains u in a Distant t.
You may choose to ignore one of the two
effects (even if it is the only one that will
affect you).
Lost at Sea
You must choose and remove 1 Ship belonging
to each Opponent that is not adjacent to
one of their Friendly Ports.
Auto-resolution: Each player chooses
for themselves.
Pirates
Place a Pirate Ship (see p. 25) into a Maritime
Trade Node of your choice. If possible,
this must be a node that has at least 1 Merchant
in it. Pirates reduce Trade Income in the
node where they are located (see p. 35).
Auto-resolution: Place the Pirate Ship
into the Trade Node with the most Merchants.
First tie breaker: Expanded node;
second tie breaker: random.
Cardinal Dies
You must remove any C, except the
Roma C, from the Papal Curia. Slide
remaining C to the left, to fill the gap.
Auto-resolution: Remove the rightmost
C belonging to the PR with the most C.
If 2 or more PRs are tied, remove the rightmost
C belonging to 1 of these PRs.
Attrition
All PRs that are at War, except you, must
remove 1 Land Unit as a Casualty for every 4
Deployed Land Units that they have.
Disloyal Vassals
Affects every PR that has any Areas with v
with either no I/M, or with fewer I
in the Area than any Opponent.
Of the Areas that qualify, any affected PR
must pick an Area with the most of their v,
gain u on all their v there, and must then
place a number of ? equal to the Tax Value
of their v with u in this Area.
You gain u as normal if affected, but do
not need to place any ?.
DNPR Expansion
For each such symbol that matches the color
of a DNPR in play (which is not currently an
Active Ally), pick a DNPR of that color.
Place a matching æ on a Province adjacent
to the DNPR. This may not be a Capital
(unless it is the last remaining Province of an
NPR), nor can it be Occupied, Owned by the
DNPR's Ally, or the Core Province of a PR.
If a Province of an NPR is selected, this
Province is taken over by the DNPR.
If the Province selected has a t/v,
place the æ underneath the t/v (thus
making it a Core Province of the DNPR) and
add u to the t/v.
From Age II onwards, for DNPRs with
a Port facing the Atlantic Ocean (any Main
Map Sea Zone with no * or †), you may
instead place a æ on any vacant Territory.
If a DNPR takes a Province from an NPR
Allied to a PR, the player may place a CB
token on the DNPR's Capital.
Auto-resolution: All DNPRs of the same
colors as the symbol Annex an adjacent NPR
Province. Prioritize Provinces in Areas where
the DNPR already Owns Provinces, then
Provinces in Areas adjacent to their Realm by
Land. They will target the eligible NPR with
the lowest Tax Income. If several Realms are
tied, use alphabetic order among adjacent
Provinces Owned by the tied Realms.
Spread of Religious Ideas
Determine where there are clusters of Infectious
Faiths (see p. 38) in play. A cluster
is any body of Areas connected by Land that
share the same Religion. A single token/
symbol in an Area which is not adjacent by
Land to any other Area with the same Religion
is considered a separate cluster.
1. Place a Protestant/Counter-Reformed
token (Q) in an Area adjacent to a
cluster, of the same type as the cluster it
is placed next to. Adjacency may here be
traced across a Sea Zone. Orthodox or
Muslim Areas may not be chosen.
Placing a Q into an Area replaces
any token that is already there.
2. If there are more clusters in play, and
you have placed less than 4 Q this Turn,
place a new Q next to another cluster,
following the rules above. Additionally:
▷ If there is more than 1 Infectious Faith
in play and you have already placed
2 Q of one type, you must place a Q
of the other type.
▷ You may not replace another Q
placed on the same Turn.
3. If there are no Infectious Faiths clusters
on the board, place Diverse Faiths tokens
instead in any 2 Catholic Areas not adjacent
to Sea Zones marked with a †.
Auto-resolution: Spread Infectious
Faiths (alternating between Protestant and
Counter-Reformed,
starting with Protestant)
into adjacent Areas: preference goes to Areas
with at least 1t; then to Areas with Provinces
of the highest total Tax Value; break ties
in alphabetical order, by Area name.
When placing Diverse Faiths tokens,
instead go in alphabetical order, ignoring
Areas that already have Diverse Faiths.
Spread of the Revolution
Deluxe Ed. / Fate of Empires expansion only
This symbol only appears on Age IV Events,
and it works in the same way as the Spread of
Religious Ideas, as described above, except
that you only place Revolutionary tokens
(^) next to clusters of ^. They may also
be placed in Orthodox or Muslim Areas.
If there are no ^ on the board, place
^ in 2 PR Capital Areas. If there is only
1 cluster of ^, also add a ^ in an Area not
adjacent to this cluster.
If there are no more available ^, you
may remove one from the board to use it.
^ are always placed on top of any existing
Religion tokens.
Auto-resolution: As above (spread of Q).
If no ^ in play, place in the Capital Areas of
2 PRs with lowest s (decide ties randomly).
Activate Power Struggle
If Power Struggles are in play, move the
Upcoming Power Struggle to the Active
Power Struggle area on the Status Mat.
Also, place § tokens in the Battleground
Areas (§) named on the activated Power
Struggle to highlight the Areas in contention.
The Active Power Struggle will be
scored in Phase 4, Step E (see p. 43).
