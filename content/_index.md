# Fan-made rules wiki for Europa Universalis: The Price of Power

The board game [Europa Universalis: The Price of Power](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/254127/europa-universalis-price-power) has many rule interactions that can be difficult to keep track of. In order to facilitate easier searching of all relevent rules related to a topic, I have started transcribing the rulebook text to this wiki format.

Use the links on the left to navigate to sections of the rules. This is a work in progress. Check the [github repo](https://github.com/DPetrusma/eutpop-wiki) for the readme, including a to-do list, as well as the place to load issues for me to resolve.
