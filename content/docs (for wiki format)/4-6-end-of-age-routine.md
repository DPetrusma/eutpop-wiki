== 4.6 End of Age Routine

When all players have completed Phase 5, and there are no more Events left in the deck for the current Age, perform the following steps in order:
# Prepare and place the '''Event Deck''' for the next Age.

	'''Note:''' If there is no next Age, move on to Final Scoring instead (see section 4.7).

# Remove all '''Milestones''' from the previous Age from the game, and replace them with 4 Milestones drawn from the deck belonging to the next Age.
# Replace any unresearched non-Basic '''Ideas''' on display with random replacements of the same type.
# The player with the least <code>0</code> on the Prestige Track may choose to replace 1 new Idea or Milestone on display with a card of their choice, chosen from the matching deck. If there is a tie for least <code>0</code>, skip this step.
# Players who have at least 1<code>M</code> in play score <code>1</code>, and must then (in updated Turn order) remove 1 of their <code>M</code> from the board (from an NPR if possible), or pay 2<code>b</code> to avoid this.

If a player removes their <code>M</code> from your Realm (forcing you to do the same from their Realm), you must still remove another <code>M</code> (if you have one), or pay 2<code>b</code>.
