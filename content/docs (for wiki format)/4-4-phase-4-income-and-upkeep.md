== 4.4 Phase 4: Income & Upkeep

In this phase, players pay Costs, collect Tax Income and <code>d</code>, and score <code>0</code>. All players perform this Phase simultaneously.

During this phase, players are allowed to take (but not repay) Loans, as described in the Take/Repay Loans Minor Action.

== A. Cut Costs ==

To reduce their expenses, players may (and must, if necessary to avoid Bankruptcy in Step B):
* Fire any Advisors they like, by discarding those Advisors' cards. 
* Disband any of their Military Units. Return any disbanded Regular Units to Available <code>m</code>, Ships to Supply, and Mercenary Units to the General Supply.
* Recall Ships at sea. Ships may return to any Friendly Port within reach of their normal Movement, via non-Hostile Sea Zones, at no <code>c</code> cost.

== B. Collect Income minus Costs ==

== D. Collect Monarch Power ==

Players then collect Monarch Power (<code>d</code>), calculated as follows:
* For each type of Monarch Power, add the Ruler's Skill of the associated type to that of the appropriate Advisor. (A PR in Interregnum is considered to have a base Skill of 1 in each Monarch Power field.)
* '''Players with +3'''<code>s</code> receive 2<code>d</code> more, of any types chosen by the player.
* '''Players with -3'''<code>s</code> receive 1<code>d</code> fewer, of any type chosen by the player. 
* '''The Papal Controller''' receives +1<code>b</code>.
* '''The Emperor of the HRE''' may receive additional <code>d</code> depending on their <code>E</code>.
* Players with certain Government Form Ideas may receive additional <code>d</code>.

== E. Score Prestige ==

* A player who is uncontested Papal Controller scores <code>0</code> equal to the number of Catholic PRs minus 1 (max. <code>3</code>).
* If <code>E</code> is at 6, the Emperor scores <code>1</code>.
* Players with the "''Absolute Monarchy''" Idea and positive <code>s</code> score <code>1</code>.
* Score any active Crusade (see p. 46) and/or Power Struggle (see p. 43), and remove the Crusade/Excommunicated token and all <code>§</code> tokens.
