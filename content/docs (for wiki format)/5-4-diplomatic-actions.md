# 5.4 Diplomatic Actions

== Covert Actions (<code>∞</code>) ==

Some Diplomatic Actions and Action Cards are labeled as ''Covert Actions'', with a <code>∞</code> icon. These are Actions that target other Realms for devious purposes, and they can be countered by the '''Counter-espionage''' card.

These are the ''Covert Actions'' available:
* '''Fabricate Claims''' (Basic Action)
* '''Support Rebels''' (Spy Network)
* '''Sow Discontent''' (Spy Network)
* '''Sabotage Reputation''' (Spy Network)
* '''New Alliance''' (Action Card)
* '''Study Technology''' (Action Card)
* '''Counterespionage''' (Action Card)

== Influence (1<code>b</code> or 3<code>D</code> per <code>I</code>) ==

Pay 1<code>b</code> for the first <code>I</code> you place, and then either 1<code>b</code> or 3<code>D</code> for each subsequent <code>I</code>.

You may place <code>I</code> in Areas adjacent to any of your <code>t</code>, <code>v</code>, <code>A</code>, <code>M</code>, or <code>I</code> that were there at the start of your Turn.

You may place as many <code>I</code> as you like, but no more than 2<code>I</code> in each Area during a single Turn.

'''Note:''' There can be no more than 5<code>I</code> in any Area. To place <code>I</code> in an Area that is "full," use the relevant ''Covert Actions''.

No <code>I</code> may be placed on any Distant Continent.

== Forge Alliance (1–3<code>b</code>) ==

To ally yourself with an NPR, pay <code>b</code> equal to half the target NPR's Tax Income (but max. 3<code>b</code>), then take an available <code>A</code> from your Supply and place it on the target's Capital, along with 1<code>I</code> in their Capital Area, if there is space.

For more details on the benefits and obligations of Alliances, see page 32.
* In order to take this Action, both you and the target NPR must be at Peace.
* You must have a total of at least 2<code>I</code> in any Area(s) belonging to the target NPR.
* If the target NPR is Allied to an Opponent, you must have more total <code>I</code> than that Opponent in the target NPR's Areas in order to replace their <code>A</code> with yours.
* To Forge an Alliance with a Distant NPR, you must have a <code>G</code> on 1+ of their Areas.

== Fabricate Claims (2<code>b</code> per <code>G</code>) – <code>∞</code> ==

This is a ''Covert Action''. Pay 2<code>b</code> per <code>G</code> to place <code>G</code> in Areas adjacent to your Realm. A <code>G</code> provides a Conquest CB against all Realms that Own Provinces in the Area in which the <code>G</code> is placed.
* You cannot place <code>G</code> in Areas where you have <code>G</code> or you Own all the Provinces.
* You must be at Peace to Fabricate Claims.
* To Fabricate a Claim on a Distant Area, it must be adjacent to your Realm by Land, and contain an NPR Province, <code>v</code>, or <code>t</code>.

== Trade (1<code>b</code>) ==

If you have an available Merchant, you may pay 1<code>b</code> to do the following in sequence:
1. Reveal 3 Trade Cards.
2. If you cannot or do not wish to make use of any of these cards, discard them all, ignore steps 3–6, and collect 2<code>D</code>.
3. Optionally move 1 of your Light Ships (using 'Naval Movement' rules, p. 25) to establish a connection to or increase your Trade Power (<code>=</code>) where you intend to Trade. You may place this ship on a Trade Protection slot (displacing any Opponent's Ship if all slots are occupied) in its destination Sea Zone. This Ship may not enter a Hostile Sea Zone.
4. Pick a revealed card that names a Trade Node where you are eligible to Trade (see below). If a Ship was moved, the chosen node must be adjacent to this Ship, or connected to your Capital Area via a chain that includes this Ship. Discard the other cards.
5. Select an available (upright) Merchant and, if not already there, move it to the Trade Node you chose. Activate this Merchant by laying it down on its side. 
6. Calculate Trade Power (see p. 35) for yourself and any Opponents with a valid connection and a Merchant (activated or not) in the selected node, and determine which of the Trade Card's income rows each player should collect income from.

'''Eligibility:''' A PR may only collect Trade Income in nodes that are connected to that PR's Capital Area through a continuous chain of intermediate Areas and/or Sea Zones containing their <code>t</code>, <code>v</code>, <code>I</code>, or Light Ships.
