== A. Update and refresh ==

All players must:

# '''Disband all Allied Units''' from their Armies, placing them in Available <code>m</code>.
# '''Update Manpower Reserve''' to reflect new <code>m</code> totals, if they have changed (from <code>t</code>/<code>v</code> gained or lost, etc.) this Round. Count Deployed Regular Units as part of this total. Increase <code>m</code> by adding Units from Supply to Available <code>m</code>. Reduce <code>m</code> by choosing Units to return to Supply.
# '''Refresh Exhausted''' <code>m</code> and repair Heavy Ships in Ports. Move ½ of Exhausted <code>m</code> (min. 3, max. 6) to Available <code>m</code>.
# '''Refresh all Merchants''' by returning them to their upright position.
# '''Add <code><</code> to the Colonist Pool''' equal to their number of Colonial <code>G</code> on the board (each PR may add max. 4<code><</code>).
# '''Remove any <code>z</code>''' from their Changed Nat. Focus slot and return it to their Supply.

# '''Remove all Units from Imperial''' <code>m</code> if the Emperor is at Peace.
# '''Remove any Tag chits''' from the ''Committed to Crusade'' slot, and, if the Emperor is at Peace, the ''Defending the HRE'' slot.
# '''Pass the First Player token''' to the player whose Round Status marker is in the ''Has Passed – 1st'' space (or the ''2nd'' space if the first to pass is the current First Player)
