# 4.1 Phase 1: Draw Cards

=== A. Reveal Events ===

Draw Event Cards according to the chosen scenario (normally equal to the number of players plus 1) from the top of the Event Deck, and place them in a face-down display next to the Event Deck. Then, flip the first 3 of these cards face-up.

=== B. Draw Action Cards ===

Going in Turn order, each player then draws 3 Action Cards, in any combination, from any of the 3 Action Card decks (Administrative, Diplomatic, or Military). Players may draw cards one by one, and should keep these cards secret from their Opponents.

=== C. Pay to keep Action Cards ===

Players must pay 2<code>D</code> for each drawn card that they wish to keep. Any drawn cards not paid for must be discarded.

=== D. Pick/Replace Missions ===

During this step, any player who has fewer than 2 Missions in their hand may pick new Missions (max. 2 in hand). All Players may also replace any of their currently held Missions.
