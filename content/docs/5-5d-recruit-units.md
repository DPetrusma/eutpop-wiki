## Recruit Units (1`c` + X`D`)

Pay 1`c` and the requisite amount of `D` to Recruit as many Military Units from your Available `m` and build as many Ships as you like (and can afford). Units may be placed directly on the board (Regular Infantry Units only) or into your Armies. New Armies may be created to hold Units that you Recruit. 

If you Recruit Units in Areas containing Enemy Units or Hostile NPR Provinces, Battles will commence there once all Recruitment is done.

**Regular Units** can be Recruited in 1 or more of your or your Vassals' Areas, up to your MC (see p. 22) in each of these Areas.

A Province cannot be counted for MC more than once per Turn, and may thus only contribute to Recruitment in a single Area.

**Mercenary Units** are taken from the General Supply and do not count towards MC. They must be Recruited in your or your Vassals' Areas, and you can Recruit a maximum of 3 Mercenary Units per Turn.

**Allied Units** in your Manpower Reserve (see p. 32) may be Recruited for free as Infantry, or optionally as Cavalry at 3`D` each. Allied Units may be Recruited in your own Areas within your MC limits. Alternatively you may instead Recruit a number of Allied Units in Areas belonging to your Active Allies, up to their MC.

**Ships** must be taken from your Supply and can be built at a maximum rate of 1 Ship in each Port you Own. Ships may be placed on a Port, or in a non-Hostile Sea Zone next to it (optionally on vacant Trade Protection slots).
