## Declare War (1`c`)

You may Declare War on any number of Realms during this Action. By doing so, you enter into a War with the target Realm(s).

**Note:** Check DoW restrictions (p. 22). You normally cannot Declare War on (**a**) your Allies, (**b**) Realms you have a Truce with, (**c**) PRs who have Passed, (**d**) NPR Allies of PRs who meet **b** or **c**, (**e**) HRE Members at Peace with the Emperor if the Emperor meets **a**, **b**, or **c**, (**f**) Distant Realms you have no `G` on, or (**g**) during an Interregnum.

Pay the Action cost, and then execute the following steps in sequence:
1. Determine Realm(s) to be targeted by your DoW and place a War token on the Capital of each Realm.
2. Lose 2`s` for each target Realm for which you have no CB (see p. 22) and 1`s` for each target Realm where you have a `M` (unless the `L` side is face-up).
3. **Calls to Arms** (in listed order):

	a. You may send *Offensive CtAs*, using the ***Call to Arms*** Action (see p. 13).\*
	
	b. If a target is an HRE Member, and you are not, the Emperor receives a *Defensive CtA* and may *Defend the HRE* (see p. 44).\*
	
	c. Targeted NPRs automatically send a *Defensive CtA* to their Ally (if any).\*
	
	d. Targeted PRs may send *Defensive CtAs*, using the ***Call to Arms*** Action (see p. 13).\*

4. Targeted PRs, and PRs accepting any *Defensive CtAs* from NPRs (unless that PR is already at War with the Aggressor), gain 1`c`.
5. Remove all of your `I` in each of the target Realm(s)'s Areas.
6. If any Ships on either side of this War are now located in Hostile Sea Zones, Naval Battles will take place (see p. 28).\*\*
7. If any Land Units on opposing sides of this War are now located in the same Area, or if PR Units now find themselves in Areas with Hostile NPR Provinces, Land Battles will take place (see p. 27).**
8. If no Battles were triggered, you may immediately either take an ***Activate Units*** or ***Recruit Units*** Action at no `c` cost.

\* PRs that are Called to Arms must respond to this as explained under 'Receiving a CtA' on p. 32.

\*\* No Battle is triggered with an NPR if there were Units/Ships Hostile to that NPR present in the Area/Sea Zone prior to the current Turn.
