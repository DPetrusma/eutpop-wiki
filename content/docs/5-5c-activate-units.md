## Activate Units (1`c`)

You may spend 1`c` to take a ***Land Activation*** or a ***Naval Activation***. Both Land and Naval Movement may include Naval Transport as part of this Action. Detailed rules for Movement, Sieges, and Battles are described in the Warfare chapter (pp. 25â€“28).

**Land Activation:** Pick an Area with at least 1 of your Armies or Regular Units, and perform one of the two options below:

- **Land Movement** (see p. 25): Move 1 of your Armies or a single Unit in this Area up to 2 spaces. It must end its movement if entering a Hostile or Neutral Area. To enter a Neutral Area, you must first obtain Military Access.

	When Units enter an Area containing Hostile Units or Enemy NPR Provinces, a Battle takes place immediately (p. 27).\*\*

- **Siege** (see p. 28): If the selected Area has Hostile Provinces, you may activate Units to Siege instead of moving.

	The Action cost pays for a single Sieging Unit. Pay 1`c` for each additional Unit that takes part in the Siege. Calculate Siege Strength and pick target Provinces.

**Naval Activation:** A Naval Activation lets you perform one of the two options below:

- **Naval Movement** (see p. 25): Choose a single destination (Sea Zone or Friendly Port), and Move any number of Ships within range to this destination. Fleets and Ships may move up to 2 spaces.
	
	You may choose a Hostile destination Sea Zone (containing Enemy Ships or facing Enemy NPR Ports), in which case a Naval Battle (see p. 28) will take place there.\*\* Ships en route may not pass through Hostile Sea Zones.
	
- **Undock:** Move any number of your Ships from Ports and into adjacent non-Hostile Sea Zones.

**Naval Transport** (see p. 26): Land Units may during **Land Movement** cross any number of Sea Zones via an existing bridge of Friendly Ships as if the Areas on either side of the bridge were adjacent by land.

Following **Naval Movement** (and after any Naval Battle), a number of Land Units can be transported via such a bridge of Ships as long as they pass through the destination Sea Zone for the Ships that were moved.

Each Ship in a Naval Bridge enables up to 3 Land Units to cross the Sea Zone that the Ship is in.

**Note:** When moving on any of the Distant Continents, movement always ends in the first space (Area or Sea Zone) you enter.

***Optional Rule 2: Available Mercenaries***

When taking an ***Activate Units*** Action to activate an Army and perform a Land Movement that originates in any of your own Areas, you may first recruit up to 3 Mercenary Units (at normal `D` cost); they must move with the activated Army.
