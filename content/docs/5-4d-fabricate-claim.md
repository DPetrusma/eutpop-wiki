## Fabricate Claims (2`b` per `G`) – `∞`

This is a *Covert Action*. Pay 2`b` per `G` to place `G` in Areas adjacent to your Realm. A `G` provides a Conquest CB against all Realms that Own Provinces in the Area in which the `G` is placed.
- You cannot place `G` in Areas where you have `G` or you Own all the Provinces.
- You must be at Peace to Fabricate Claims.
- To Fabricate a Claim on a Distant Area, it must be adjacent to your Realm by Land, and contain an NPR Province, `v`, or `t`.
