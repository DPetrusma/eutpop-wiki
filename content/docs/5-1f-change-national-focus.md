# Change National Focus

When taking this Action you must perform one or both of the options below, in order. You may only take this Action once per Round. Place a `z` in the *Changed Nat. Focus* slot on your Player Mat to indicate that you have done so.
1. Increase one type of Monarch Power by up to 2`d` by moving a maximum 1`d` from each of the other two Monarch Power pools on your Player Mat.
2. Discard up to 3 Action Cards from your hand (add them to the discard pile after completing this Action). Then draw 1 card fewer than you discarded, from any of the Action Decks.

	You may pay 1`d` and 2`D` to pick 1 of the new cards from the top 5 discards of the deck matching the paid `d` type.
