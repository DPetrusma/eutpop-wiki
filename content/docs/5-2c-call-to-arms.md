# Call to Arms (0–2`I` per `A`) – `£`

This Action may only be taken in conjunction with your own DoW or as a *Reaction* in response to a DoW on you or your NPR Ally.

When you are the Aggressor in a War, your CtAs are considered to be *Offensive CtAs*. For 
*Offensive CtAs*, you must discard 2`I` from the Areas of each NPR Ally you wish to call.

When War has been Declared upon you, you may send *Defensive CtAs*. For *Defensive CtAs*, you must discard 1`I` from the Areas of each NPR Ally you wish to call.

You may also send *Defensive CtAs* when accepting a CtA from an NPR Ally, but only to call your other NPR Allies (not PR Allies).

Calling your PR Allies to War has no cost, but they may refuse (see rules for 'Receiving a CtA', p. 32). If a PR is Allied both to the Aggressor and the defender, they may only be Called to Arms by the defender.

NPR Allies can only be Called to Arms if:
- They are at Peace.
- They are adjacent either to your Realm, or to a new Enemy.

For each NPR Ally Called to Arms:
- Flip the `A` to the `K` (Active Ally) side
- Add a number of NPR Units to your own Available `m` equal to ½ of the Tax Value of all Provinces Owned by that NPR Ally and their Vassals (max. 5 Units).
- Gain 1`c` if the NPR Ally is adjacent to a new Enemy.
