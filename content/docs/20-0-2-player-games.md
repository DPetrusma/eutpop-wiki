# 20. 2-Player Games

## 20.1 2 Players + Bot(s)

The default way to set up a 2-player game is  to pick a 3- or 4-player scenario and replace  the missing players with bots.

See the Solo & Bot Rules booklet for how  to play a game with bots.

## 20.2 No Bots Variant

In a 2-player game without bots, during setup organize the Event Decks as if there were 4 players but use only the Realm-specific Events for the 2 Player Realms in play, and use B-Events instead of Realm-specific Events for the third and fourth PR.

During play, reveal Events as in a 4-player game. Each player must take 2 ***Event*** Actions each Action Phase before they may Pass.

The first player to Pass collects 3`D`, then the remaining player may take 2 Turns before they must Pass. If the remaining player still has not taken any of their ***Event*** Actions at this stage, they may nonetheless take 1 other Action of their choice in addition to their ***Event*** Actions. The second player to Pass collects no `D` upon Passing.

The First Player is allowed to retain the First Player token by Passing first.
