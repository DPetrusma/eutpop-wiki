## Trade (1`b`)

If you have an available Merchant, you may pay 1`b` to do the following in sequence:
1. Reveal 3 Trade Cards.
2. If you cannot or do not wish to make use of any of these cards, discard them all, ignore steps 3â€“6, and collect 2`D`.
3. Optionally move 1 of your Light Ships (using 'Naval Movement' rules, p. 25) to establish a connection to or increase your Trade Power (`=`) where you intend to Trade. You may place this ship on a Trade Protection slot (displacing any Opponent's Ship if all slots are occupied) in its destination Sea Zone. This Ship may not enter a Hostile Sea Zone.
4. Pick a revealed card that names a Trade Node where you are eligible to Trade (see below). If a Ship was moved, the chosen node must be adjacent to this Ship, or connected to your Capital Area via a chain that includes this Ship. Discard the other cards.
5. Select an available (upright) Merchant and, if not already there, move it to the Trade Node you chose. Activate this Merchant by laying it down on its side. 
6. Calculate Trade Power (see p. 35) for yourself and any Opponents with a valid connection and a Merchant (activated or not) in the selected node, and determine which of the Trade Card's income rows each player should collect income from.

**Eligibility:** A PR may only collect Trade Income in nodes that are connected to that PR's Capital Area through a continuous chain of intermediate Areas and/or Sea Zones containing their `t`, `v`, `I`, or Light Ships.
