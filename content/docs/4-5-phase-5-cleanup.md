# 4.5 Phase 5: Cleanup

## A. Update and refresh

All players must:

1. **Disband all Allied Units** from their Armies, placing them in Available `m`.
2. **Update Manpower Reserve** to reflect new `m` totals, if they have changed (from `t`/`v` gained or lost, etc.) this Round. Count Deployed Regular Units as part of this total. Increase `m` by adding Units from Supply to Available `m`. Reduce `m` by choosing Units to return to Supply.
3. **Refresh Exhausted** `m` and repair Heavy Ships in Ports. Move ½ of Exhausted `m` (min. 3, max. 6) to Available `m`.
4. **Refresh all Merchants** by returning them to their upright position.
5. **Add `<` to the Colonist Pool** equal to their number of Colonial `G` on the board (each PR may add max. 4`<`).
6. **Remove any `z`** from their Changed Nat. Focus slot and return it to their Supply.

## B. Board and Status Mat Cleanup

1. **Remove `A` from Bots, and from DNPRs** that have a Tax Income of 10+`D`.
2. **Remove all `H` from the map boards.**
3. **Adjust Imperial** `I` to match `E`. The Emperor may (re)distribute Imperial `I` in any HRE Areas with space.
4. **Remove all Units from Imperial** `m` if the Emperor is at Peace.
5. **Remove any Tag chits** from the *Committed to Crusade* slot, and, if the Emperor is at Peace, the *Defending the HRE* slot.
6. **Pass the First Player token** to the player whose Round Status marker is in the *Has Passed – 1st* space (or the *2nd* space if the first to pass is the current First Player)
7. **Reset all Round Status markers** to the Event not Taken space.

## C. Discard down to 5 Action Cards

All players must discard down to a maximum hand size of 5 Action Cards. Players may choose which card(s) to discard.

Display Cards that are in play do not count towards the 5-card limit.

## D. End of Age Routine

If it is the end of an Age, perform the End of Age Routine described below.
