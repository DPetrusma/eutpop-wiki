# 5.2 Minor Actions

Minor Actions do not complete your Turn but may be performed in addition to your normal Turn Action. Minor Actions may be taken on the Turn that you Pass, but you may not take them again in this Round once you have Passed unless as a *Reaction*.

## Reactions (`£`)

Some Minor Actions may, under certain circumstances, be performed as *Reactions*. It is possible to play a *Reaction* on another player's Turn, after you have Passed, or even outside of the Action Phase.

These Actions are marked with the `£` icon, and the conditions under which these may be performed as *Reactions* are stated in each Action's description.

Action Cards may also be labeled as *Reactions*.
