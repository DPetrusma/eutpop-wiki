# 4.4 Phase 4: Income & Upkeep

In this phase, players pay Costs, collect Tax Income and `d`, and score `0`. All players perform this Phase simultaneously.

During this phase, players are allowed to take (but not repay) Loans, as described in the Take/Repay Loans Minor Action.

## A. Cut Costs

To reduce their expenses, players may (and must, if necessary to avoid Bankruptcy in Step B):
- Fire any Advisors they like, by discarding those Advisors' cards. 
- Disband any of their Military Units. Return any disbanded Regular Units to Available `m`, Ships to Supply, and Mercenary Units to the General Supply.
- Recall Ships at sea. Ships may return to any Friendly Port within reach of their normal Movement, via non-Hostile Sea Zones, at no `c` cost.

## B. Collect Income minus Costs

| Source				| Income/Cost |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| + Base Tax Income		| Income indicated on Town Tracks (Small Town and Large Town Track combined)
| + Vassal Tax Income	| Income indicated on Vassal Track
| – Advisor Upkeep 		| As stated on the cards (1–4`D` per Advisor). Papal Controller: Pay 1`D` fewer per Advisor
| – Military Maintenance (for Deployed Units)	| 	1`D` per Regular Unit |
|												|2`D` per Mercenary |
|												|½`D` for every Ship remaining at sea |
| – Interest on Loans	| 1`D` per`,` |
| – Plague Effects		| ½`D` is lost per 1`D` of Tax Income from Areas with a `H` |
| +/– `s`Modifier 		| +2`D` for positive `s` |
|						| -2`D` for negative `s` |
| + Emperor's `E`		| Equal to `E` value |
| + Income for Ideas	| See "Bureaucracy" Idea |

## C. Corruption

Cost to keep Ducats in your Treasury (you may decide not to keep all of your Ducats):
- **0–49** `D`: no cost
- **50–59** `D`: pay 1`a` or gain 1`,`
- **60–69** `D`: pay 2`a`; gain 1`,` per unpaid `a`
- **70–79** `D`: pay 3`a`; gain 1`,` per unpaid `a`
- **Etc.**

## D. Collect Monarch Power

Players then collect Monarch Power (`d`), calculated as follows:
- For each type of Monarch Power, add the Ruler's Skill of the associated type to that of the appropriate Advisor. (A PR in Interregnum is considered to have a base Skill of 1 in each Monarch Power field.)
- **Players with +3**`s` receive 2`d` more, of any types chosen by the player.
- **Players with -3**`s` receive 1`d` fewer, of any type chosen by the player. 
- **The Papal Controller** receives +1`b`.
- **The Emperor of the HRE** may receive additional `d` depending on their `E`.
- Players with certain Government Form Ideas may receive additional `d`.

## E. Score Prestige

- A player who is uncontested Papal Controller scores `0` equal to the number of Catholic PRs minus 1 (max. `3`).
- If `E` is at 6, the Emperor scores `1`.
- Players with the "*Absolute Monarchy*" Idea and positive `s` score `1`.
- Score any active Crusade (see p. 46) and/or Power Struggle (see p. 43), and remove the Crusade/Excommunicated token and all `§` tokens.
