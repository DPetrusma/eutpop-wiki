# Player-to-Player Diplomacy

This Action lets you make an agreement with another player, to conduct various transactions.

You may only have diplomatic exchanges with 1 PR each time you take this Action. You may not perform 'Monetary Support' and 'Buy/Sell Provinces' in the same Turn, but all other combinations are possible. If either Realm is at War, 'Monetary Support' is the only transaction that may take place.

**Alliances and Marriages:** Entering into an Alliance or Royal Marriage with another PR each costs 1`b` for the Active Player. Both players must place a `A`/`M` on the other PR's Capital as appropriate.

When entering into a Marriage, both players may draw an Action Card of a type chosen by the Active Player.

**Monetary Support:** Give or receive `D`. The Active Player must pay 1`b` for every 10`D` (rounded up) that changes hands, whether they are giving or receiving `D`.

**Buy/Sell Provinces:** To buy Provinces from another player, the buyer must have `G` in all Areas where those Provinces are located. The minimum price per Province sold is 3`D`, and the maximum is 15`D`.

Both buyer and seller must also pay 1`a` to take part in such a transaction. A player selling any of their Core Provinces loses `0` equal to twice those Provinces' Tax Value. Vassal Provinces cannot be bought or sold.

***Optional Rule 1: Secret Negotiations***

By spending 1 additional `b` you may have a private, 3-minute conference with another player. All other in-game communication must take place openly.
