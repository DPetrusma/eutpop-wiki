# Take/Repay Loan – `£`

You may take Loans, as long as you do not already have 5 or more Interest tokens in your Treasury. Taking a Loan may be done as a *Reaction* if you must cover a cost and lack the funds to do so. When you take a Loan, take an Interest token and 5`D` from the General Supply and add them to your Treasury.

To repay a Loan, pay 6`D` from your Treasury and return the Interest token to the General Supply. You may immediately use Ducats gained for Passing for this purpose.
