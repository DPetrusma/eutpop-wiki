## Influence (1`b` or 3`D` per `I`)

Pay 1`b` for the first `I` you place, and then either 1`b` or 3`D` for each subsequent `I`.

You may place `I` in Areas adjacent to any of your `t`, `v`, `A`, `M`, or `I` that were there at the start of your Turn.

You may place as many `I` as you like, but no more than 2`I` in each Area during a single Turn.

**Note:** There can be no more than 5`I` in any Area. To place `I` in an Area that is "full," use the relevant *Covert Actions*.

No `I` may be placed on any Distant Continent.
