# Colonize ( 4`a`/`<`)

To take a Colonize Action, spend 4`a` or 4 of your `<` from the Colonist Pool (or any combination of those totaling 4), then replace 1 of your `G` on a vacant Territory with a Small `t`. This Colonial `G` must be connected to your Capital Area through a continuous chain of intermediate Areas and Sea Zones with your `t` and/or Ships.
