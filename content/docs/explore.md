# 5.1 Explore (1`b` + 1`c`)

Requires *"Quest for the New World"* (*"QftNW"*) Idea to use Ships for Exploring.
When taking this Action, follow the steps below in sequence:
1. If you have *"QftNW"*, you may move **1** Light Ship (using rules for Naval Movement, p. 25) into a Sea Zone on one of the Distant Continents. The Ship may not enter a Hostile Sea Zone.
2. Roll the Exploration Die, then either use the result (as described below) or pay 1`b` to re-roll:
    - **Result with no `j`**: Discover a Territory matching the number rolled, or a Distant Area with an NPR Province, a `t`, or a `v`.
    - **Result with `j`**: Pay 1`b` to Discover a Territory matching the number rolled, or: fail Exploration and remove 1 of your Ships on a Distant Continent.
	
    Any Discovery made must be adjacent to your Realm or, if you have *"QftNW"*, 1 of your Ships. Place a `G` on the Discovered Area. `G` placed on vacant Territories are called **Colonial Claims**.
    You may pay to re-roll a maximum of 2 times; you must use the result of the last roll you make.

3. When the first Area on a Distant Continent is Discovered (`G` has been placed), add all unused Trade Cards matching the number for this continent (see p. 35), and reshuffle the deck.
