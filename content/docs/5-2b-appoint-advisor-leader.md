# Appoint Advisor/Leader – `£`

Take this Action to hire Advisors (square portrait) and Leaders (round portrait) on cards in your hand, and/or fire active ones. 

**Appoint Advisor:** Pay the `D` cost shown in the card's lower-right corner, then tuck that card under its matching Advisor slot on your Player Mat. 

**Appoint General/Admiral:** Pay the `c` cost stated in the card's lower-right corner to employ a Leader as a General or an Admiral (see p. 23). Tuck that card under one of your Army/Fleet Mats. You may also use this Action to freely reassign a General from one of your Armies to another. If someone attacks one of your Armies located within your Realm, you may, as a *Reaction*, Appoint or reassign a General to this Army.

**Appoint New Ruler:** If you currently have no Ruler (or if the Ruler is named "Interregnum"), you may take a Leader from your hand and appoint them as your new Ruler for free. Appointing a new Ruler may be performed as a *Reaction* if the current Ruler is discarded without any replacement.
