# Event (mandatory)

During each Action Phase, each player **must** take this Action once, and only once, before they can Pass.

When taking this Action, do as follows:
1. Select a face-up Event from the Event Display, collect any Ducats that are on it, and move your Round Status marker to the *Event Taken* space.
2. Place 2`D` from the General Supply on any remaining face-up Events.
3. Play the Event and resolve its effects. If the Event offers a choice of effects (such as **A** or **B**), choose only 1 to resolve.
4. Resolve any symbols at the bottom of the Event from left to right (see p. 41).
5. If the Event is associated with your own Realm, you must replace your current Ruler with any Ruler on this card.

	If the Event is associated with another Realm, that player must choose whether or not to appoint the Ruler on this card.
	
6. If you are the last player to take the ***Event*** Action this Round and there is still an unpicked Event remaining, resolve the bottom row of symbols on that Event using the auto-resolution rules (p. 41).

	The Event text itself on the unpicked Event does not take effect. However, if it has a historical Ruler on it, the player associated with that Event may pay 2`a` to appoint the Ruler on the card.
	
7. Turn over a face-down Event, if any remain.

Whenever an effect on an Event says "you," that effect applies to the Active Player or to the player required to make an A/B-choice.
