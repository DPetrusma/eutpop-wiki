## Forge Alliance (1â€“3`b`)

To ally yourself with an NPR, pay `b` equal to half the target NPR's Tax Income (but max. 3`b`), then take an available `A` from your Supply and place it on the target's Capital, along with 1`I` in their Capital Area, if there is space.

For more details on the benefits and obligations of Alliances, see page 32.
- In order to take this Action, both you and the target NPR must be at Peace.
- You must have a total of at least 2`I` in any Area(s) belonging to the target NPR.
- If the target NPR is Allied to an Opponent, you must have more total `I` than that Opponent in the target NPR's Areas in order to replace their `A` with yours.
- To Forge an Alliance with a Distant NPR, you must have a `G` on 1+ of their Areas.
