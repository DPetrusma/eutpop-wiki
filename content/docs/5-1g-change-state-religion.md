# Change State Religion

Starting with Age II, this Action allows a Realm to change its State Religion from Catholic to Protestant (or from Protestant to Catholic). Otherwise, changing State Religion can only happen through an Event, or if Conversion is forced upon you (p. 31).

This Action has no Monarch Power cost, but you must instead face the following consequences:
- Lose `2` and 1`s`
- Remove 1`M` and 5`I` (in total) from any Area(s) that belong to the Religion that you are abandoning.
- Place the removed `I` into Areas with the same faith as your new State Religion. 
- Gain 1`u` in each of your Areas of the Religion you abandoned. Then roll Rebel Dice (see p. 37) for these Areas.

Alternatively, if there is at least 1 Counter-Reformed token on the board (e.g., following the *Council of Trent* Event), Catholic PRs may pay 3`a` to embrace the Counter-Reformation and place a Counter-Reformed token in their Capital Area without suffering any of the consequences listed above.
